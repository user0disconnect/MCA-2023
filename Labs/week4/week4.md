# Week 4: Computational Analytics of Notated Music

## Task 1: Generating a Piano Roll and Pitch Histogram using music21

## 1. Pitch Histogram 
***A pitch bar graph shows how many times a particular note has been played in a song. In my case, the most common pitch in Arvo PÃ¤rt's Spiegel im Spiegel is C5.***![](https://github.com/user0disconnect/MCA-2023/blob/3433255ff5b5dca80c4ba633495cc88b6121ff4c/histograms/pitch_histogram.png) 
## 2. **Piano Roll** 
***Piano roll is a diagram that shows the time position of each note, where it starts playing, its duration (length), and pitch.*** ![](https://github.com/user0disconnect/MCA-2023/blob/3433255ff5b5dca80c4ba633495cc88b6121ff4c/histograms/%D0%B7iano_roll_of_pitches.png)
## 3. **Scatter Plot of Pitches** 
***This pitch scatter plot shows the correlation between pitch and note length.*** ![](https://github.com/user0disconnect/MCA-2023/blob/3433255ff5b5dca80c4ba633495cc88b6121ff4c/histograms/scatter_plot_of_pitches.png)
