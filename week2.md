# Week 2: Notation basics

For this week, I decided to transcribe Arvo Pärt's composition **Spiegel im Spiegel** using MuseScore, the finished file can be found below or [here](https://github.com/user0disconnect/MCA-2023/blob/cc7d9f8e096afdcf995462c57e650eb1df212593/spiegel_im_spiegel_part.mscz).

Here are a few changes I made to the file, as the program was not transcribing the notes correctly at first.

- I changed the arrangement, because at the beginning the OMR engine counted everything as Voice.
   
- Changed the tempo from 120 to the original 84.
   
 - Changed the time signature from 3/4 to 6/4.
   
- The engine didn't recognise the octaves, so I added an ottava 8va alta.
   
- Also I added the name of the piece and the artist.
